## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
grandparents <- read.csv("/Users/gracielleli/Downloads/drive-download-20241002T145736Z-001/grandparent_height.csv")
grandparents

t.test(x = grandparents$child_ht, y = grandparents$gparent_ht)
lm(child_ht ~ gparent_ht, data = grandparents)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r cars}
cars
```
